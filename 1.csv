While his postal address may read ‘United Kingdom’, Pages’ work has legs that ensure his dreams never stop sprinting from country to country.Unwilling to be constrained by restrictive labels of the design industry, Jordi can only be described as an expert in the experimental – the artist specialises in creating animation, graphics and light projections from a different world.In 2010, Pages joined forces with design studio Seeper and, in less than two years, climbed collaborative constellations and projective pipe dreams to the award of 3D Motion Graphics leader, a large feat for such a small amount of time.Perhaps what makes Pages a cut above the terrestrial rest is his involvement in linguistics and languages – his role as lecturer at the University of Arts London breathes down the neck of each and every short film narrative the designer creates.It’s not often visual brilliance and daring dialogue come hand in hand.The abstract musings of Jordi begin with a pen and paper, no more. The designer believes in using the minimal, the bare, before allowing technologic interfaces in on his artistic genius.Darker, deeper and wilder than the end animation itself, Jordi Pages’ sketches give us but an insight into what his illusively creative mind might harbour.Birth, death, and alien entities, along with existentialism, all come to mind in viewing the experimenter’s best – a feeling that stays with audiences long after screenings conclude.- Sophie Lane - 2012 <span class='variable-text-link fake-link'> Read Less</span></div>"

Your visit to this page speaks to the fact that you want to learn more about me. It is a pleasure to me, thank you for your interest. Check my Telegram Channel: https://t.me/yakovlevv_comBackground =============I took to designing in 2009. My first orders involved designing business cards, leaflets, and other printed products. Ater several months, I designed my first website. To be honest, it was so-so. Any designer, looking at his/her first works, would prefer nobody to see them ever. But time was passing by, and I practiced a lot. After a while, I started doing works at a good level. 💼 Projects over 10 years =============Ten years have passed since then, and I had to do many projects of different complexity and specifics, including: ⚡ Multipage corporate websites. ⚡ Online stores. ⚡ Landing pages. ⚡ Web services. ⚡ Mobile apps. ⚡ Presentations. ⚡ Corporate identity. ⚡ Logos. Over this time I realized that I like web design, UX/UI, and mobile apps the most. These were the fields I was sharpening my skills in for the last several years. Please note that I am engaged exclusively in drafting and designing. I do not write texts, do not make layouts, and do not code. Although I have such experience. But I do not like it. I like designing. If you need a turnkey website, I won't help. But if you need professional and high-quality design - you are welcome, while I will provide you with contacts of layout designers and programmers, if necessary. 📅 Today =============At the moment, I work for the large Moscow advertising agency as an Art Director, and along with it, I do design projects beyond the agency employment. Among wide-known companies I provided design services to, are: ⚡ Suzuki. ⚡ Shell. ⚡ Toyota. ⚡ Lada. ⚡ Hexoral. ⚡ Nicorette. ⚡ Johnson & Johnson. ⚡ RZD. ⚡ Amway. In 2018, I have implemented 86 projects alone. On average, it makes one project per 4 days. The statistics shows that customers approved and accepted more than 90% of the projects. How many people can boast such performance? Not sure that a lot of. This is because I am really engaged in it for years, and offer both quality and promptness. Therefore if you want to get a project to make your business on the rise, contact me, I will be glad to be of help. <span class='variable-text-link fake-link'> Read Less</span></div>"
