Your visit to this page speaks to the fact that you want to learn more about me. It is a pleasure to me, thank you for your interest. Check my Telegram Channel: https://t.me/yakovlevv_comBackground =============I took to designing in 2009. My first orders involved designing business cards, leaflets, and other printed products. Ater several months, I designed my first website. To be honest, it was so-so. Any designer, looking at his/her first works, would prefer nobody to see them ever. But time was passing by, and I practiced a lot. After a while, I started doing works at a good level. üíº Projects over 10 years =============Ten years have passed since then, and I had to do many projects of different complexity and specifics, including: ‚ö° Multipage corporate websites. ‚ö° Online stores. ‚ö° Landing pages. ‚ö° Web services. ‚ö° Mobile apps. ‚ö° Presentations. ‚ö° Corporate identity. ‚ö° Logos. Over this time I realized that I like web design, UX/UI, and mobile apps the most. These were the fields I was sharpening my skills in for the last several years. Please note that I am engaged exclusively in drafting and designing. I do not write texts, do not make layouts, and do not code. Although I have such experience. But I do not like it. I like designing. If you need a turnkey website, I won't help. But if you need professional and high-quality design - you are welcome, while I will provide you with contacts of layout designers and programmers, if necessary. üìÖ Today =============At the moment, I work for the large Moscow advertising agency as an Art Director, and along with it, I do design projects beyond the agency employment. Among wide-known companies I provided design services to, are: ‚ö° Suzuki. ‚ö° Shell. ‚ö° Toyota. ‚ö° Lada. ‚ö° Hexoral. ‚ö° Nicorette. ‚ö° Johnson & Johnson. ‚ö° RZD. ‚ö° Amway. In 2018, I have implemented 86 projects alone. On average, it makes one project per 4 days. The statistics shows that customers approved and accepted more than 90% of the projects. How many people can boast such performance? Not sure that a lot of. This is because I am really engaged in it for years, and offer both quality and promptness. Therefore if you want to get a project to make your business on the rise, contact me, I will be glad to be of help. <span class='variable-text-link fake-link'> Read Less</span></div>"

The designer believes in using the minimal, the bare, before allowing technologic interfaces in on his artistic genius.Darker, deeper and wilder than the end animation itself, Jordi Pages‚Äô sketches give us but an insight into what his illusively creative mind might harbour.Birth, death, and alien entities, along with existentialism, all come to mind in viewing the experimenter‚Äôs best ‚Äì a feeling that stays with audiences long after screenings conclude.- Sophie Lane - 2012 <span class='variable-text-link fake-link'> Read Less</span></div>"

Naming, art direction, graphic design, creation of advertising campaigns ‚ÄìI believe I have pulled all the strings.I must thank the music scene for its extreme sensitiveness to the passing of time and trends. Working in it has forged in me a plastic spirit; it has forced me to be under a constant creative evolution. In this sphere there is a vast offer and its public are avid and fleeting ¬≠‚Äìbut often fickle‚Äì consumers. To stand out is essential, and creativity is the means to achieve it. To my mind, however, not everything goes. I have my own recipe. In such a visually polluted environment I try to come up with fresh and memorable designs with a clear aim at essential beauty and equilibrium that, at the same time, will ensure communicative effectiveness. I seek to whet the eye, I want the visual impact to remain in people‚Äôs memory, I aspire to seduce minds through contrast.You can judge by yourselves from the collection of work displayed here for you.
